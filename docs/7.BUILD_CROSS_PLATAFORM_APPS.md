## Setup

We configure the Electron builder packager into [quasar.config.js](../quasar.config.js), starting in line `202`.

To build to all platforms and avoid the following error, we recommend to run your IDE as `Administrator`.

> **Note:** The following error will be displayed in your terminal if you doesn't run as administrator in windows:
>
> `Cannot create symlinks (on Windows hosts, it requires admin privileges)`
