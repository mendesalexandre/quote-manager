## Project Structure (/ui)

- `build` - contains build-related configuration files. In most cases you don't need to touch them.

- `src` - contains the source code, obviously. The codebase is written in ES2015.

  - `components` - JS, Sass and JSON (API) files for Quasar Vue components

  - `composables` - Quasar's composables for Vue 3 Composition API

  - `directives` - Vue directives supplied by Quasar

  - `plugins` - Quasar plugins

  - `css` - Sass definitions and core code for Quasar themes

  - `utils` - utilities used by the framework and exported to the public API

- `lang` - Quasar language packs

- `icon-set` - Quasar icon sets

- `dist` - contains built files for distribution (only after a build). Note this directory is only updated when a release happens; they do not reflect the latest changes in development branches.

- `dev` - app with Quasar sources linked directly used for testing purposes. Each feature/component has its own `*.vue` file. Adding a new file automatically creates a route for it and adds it to the "homepage" list (based on the file name).
